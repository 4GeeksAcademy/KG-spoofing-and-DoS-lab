## üå± How to start a project?


### Local Installation:
Clone the repository to your local environment [repository](https://github.com/breatheco-de/spoofing-and-DDoS-lab) and follow the instructions in the README file.


### Requirements

To carry out this project, we will need 2 virtual machines. One will be the Debian virtual machine where we previously built the WordPress website, and the other will be the Kali virtual machine as the attacker.

* Oracle VirtualBox
* Virtual machine with Kali Linux (Attacker).
* Virtual machine with Debian (Web Server): Where we have the Apache server and the WordPress site hosted.
* Spoofing and DDoS tools installed on virtual machines.
* An isolated network environment or a lab network.
* Tools needed?

## üìù Instructions

### Step 1: Configure the Network in VirtualBox

#### Configure the Network of the Debian Machine (Web Server):
* Open VirtualBox.
* Select your Debian virtual machine and click on "Settings".
* Go to the "Network" section.
* Configure "Adapter 1" as "Internal Network".
* In the "Name" field, enter a name for the internal network, for example, "LabNetwork".
* Save the changes and close the settings window.


#### Configure the Network of the Kali Linux Machine (Attacker):
* Select your Kali Linux virtual machine and click on "Settings".
* Go to the "Network" section.
* Configure "Adapter 1" as "Internal Network".
* In the "Name" field, select the same internal network name you used for the Debian machine ("LabNetwork").
* Save the changes and close the settings window.

### Step 2: Obtain the IP Address of the Machines to Connect Them.

#### On the Debian Machine (Web Server):
* Start the Debian virtual machine.
* Open a terminal and execute the following command to view the assigned IP address:
```bash
$ ip addr show
```
> ***Look for the section corresponding to your network interface (usually `eth0` o `enp0s3`) and find the line that starts with inet. There you will see the assigned IP address, something like `192.168.1.x`.***

#### On the Kali Linux Machine (Attacker):
* Open a terminal and execute the following command to view the assigned IP address:
* Abre una terminal y ejecuta el siguiente comando para ver la direcci√≥n IP asignada:

```bash
$ ip addr show
```

> ***Look for the section corresponding to your network interface (usually `eth0` o `enp0s3`) and find the line that starts with inet. There you will see the assigned IP address, something like `192.168.1.x`.***


### Step 3: Verify the Connection Between the Machines

#### From the Kali Linux Machine (Attacker):
* Open a terminal and ping the Debian machine to verify the connection:

```bash
$ ping <IP_debian>
```

> Replace <IP_debian> with the IP address you obtained for the Debian machine.

#### From the Debian Machine (Web Server): 
* Open a terminal and ping the Kali Linux machine to verify the connection:

```bash
$ ping <IP_kali>
```
> Replace <IP_kali> with the IP address you obtained for the Kali machine.
